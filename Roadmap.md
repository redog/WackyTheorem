# Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Unified Data Vault

Objective: Establish the foundational data layer. The primary goal is to securely ingest, encrypt, and store data from multiple sources directly on the user's device.

Key Outcomes: A desktop application that can connect to at least two data sources (e.g., Google and a browser plugin), pull data, and store it in an encrypted local database.

Milestone for Phase 1: Successfully connect to a Google account and a browser, ingest data from both, and view the encrypted, normalized data within the basic desktop app UI.

# Phase 2: Personal LLM & Temporal Graph

Objective: Leverage the stored data by building the on-device intelligence layer. The goal is to enable natural language queries over the user's personal data.

Key Outcomes: A user can ask a simple question in the app (e.g., "what meetings did I have last Tuesday?") and receive an accurate answer generated by the local LLM.

Milestone for Phase 2: User can ask a temporal query like "What did I do the week of July 4th, 2025?" and see a timeline of events constructed from their ingested data.

# Phase 3: Action API & Mobile Foundation

Objective: Make the insights actionable and lay the groundwork for mobile.

Key Outcomes: A developer can write a simple "skill" (e.g., "draft an email reply"). The user can trigger this skill from the LLM's output. A basic Kotlin Multiplatform project is created.

Milestone for Phase 3: After asking the LLM to summarize an email, the user is presented with a button to "Draft Reply," which triggers a skill to open a new email draft.

# Phase 4: Health & Wellness Loop

Objective: Demonstrate a powerful, domain-specific application of the platform.

Key Outcomes: The app can connect to Apple Health, ingest data, and the LLM can answer questions about wellness trends.

Milestone for Phase 4: A user can ask, "How did my activity levels last week compare to the week before?" and receive a summary with charts on the mobile app.

# Phase 5: Demo Polish, Testing & Deployment

Objective: Ensure the demo is stable, performant, and presents a compelling narrative.

Key Outcomes: A polished, packaged demo application ready for presentation.

Final Milestone: A fully functional and polished demo is deployed and ready.
